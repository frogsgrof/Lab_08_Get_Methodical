    /*
    This program does not use any of the previous methods but requires you to write an additional one.

Create a method (in SafeInput) that creates a Pretty header NOT AT ALL like this:

*****************************************************************
***                                     Message Centered Here                                           ***
*****************************************************************
public static void prettyHeader(String msg)

The output is always 60 characters wide for each line.  Use loops to print out the lines.  Long output statements of stars are not allowed!  (Use loops instead.)
Center the msg on the second line with 3 stars on either end.  HINT: use msg.length() to determine the length in characters of the msg and then use this info to calculate how to center it within the 60 character wide header.
