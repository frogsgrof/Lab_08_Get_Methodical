    Create a static method that takes a Celsius value (Java double) and returns the equivalent
    Fahrenheit value as a double.

public static double CtoF(double Celsius)
This is a one off method so place it in the same file as your program code.
Note that you place it outside of and after main within the class body.
Now code a program that creates a tabular display of two columns with the Celsius value on the
left and the equivalent Fahrenheit value on the right.

The table should show degrees centigrade in 1 degree increments from -100 to 100.
